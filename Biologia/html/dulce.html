    <p class="inf">The manufacturing of electronic devices such as cell phones, tablets, laptops, and video game consoles involves the extraction of minerals like coltan, lithium, and cobalt. These resources, essential for the functioning of batteries and circuits, are often obtained through illegal mining, especially in tropical regions of Africa and South America. This activity not only contributes to massive deforestation and the destruction of ecosystems, but also contaminates water sources with toxic substances, affecting both local wildlife and human communities. As a result, biodiversity is lost, soil balance is disrupted, and the environment is degraded. Furthermore, when these devices no longer serve a purpose or are discarded due to obsolescence, they become electronic waste, which often contains heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and cadmium. If not managed properly, these elements can leach into the soil and water, causing serious ecological damage and posing a risk to human health.
